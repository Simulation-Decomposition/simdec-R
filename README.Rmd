# SimDec

![](man/figures/logo.png)

**Simulation decomposition** or **SimDec** is an uncertainty and sensitivity analysis method, which is based on Monte Carlo simulation. SimDec consists of three major parts:

1. computing sensitivity indices,
2. creating multi-variable scenarios and mapping the output values to them, and
3. visualizing the scenarios on the output distribution by color-coding its segments.

**SimDec** reveals the nature of causalities and interaction effects in the model. Lets have a look at how it works in R!

### Installation


```{r, warning = FALSE, message= FALSE}
devtools::install_github("Simulation-Decomposition/simdec-R")
```

```{r, include = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
# Guard so knitting doesn’t crash if SimDec isn’t installed yet
if (!requireNamespace("SimDec", quietly = TRUE)) {
  stop("SimDec is not installed. Run the install chunk once, then knit again.")
} else {
  library(SimDec)
}
```

### Loading Data

First the simulated 'inputs' and the 'output' need to be specified. They can result from a Monte Carlo simulation arranged directly in R, or conducted elsewhere and then loaded through a file, like in this example. Lets use the the first example data that comes with the R package.

```{r}
data(example_data)                                              
output <- example_data[,1]                                      
inputs <- example_data[,2:5]                                    
```

### Compute Sensitivity Indices

Function `sensitivity_indices` computes first-order effects `FOE` (main individual effect of every input variable), second-order effects `SOE` (interaction effects between pairs of variables and combined sensitivity indices `SI`.

```{r, include = TRUE}
sen    <- sensitivity_indices(output, inputs)     
SI     <- sen$SI                                  
print(round(SI, 4))                                         
print(round(sen$FOE, 4))                                    
print(round(sen$SOE, 4))                                    
```
Each value shows what portion of the variance of the output is explained (negative SOE values indicate correlation). In this example, SI shows that the most significant inputs are X2 (52%) and X4 (35%). SOE points out that there is interaction between X2 and X3 (11%) and correlation between X2 and X3 (-6%).

### Visualize

The function 'simdec_visualization'

1. Chooses the most important input variables
2. Breaks them down into states
3. Forms scenarios out of all combinations of those states
4. Maps the scenarios onto the output values
5. Visualizes these scenarios by color-coding the distribution of the output.

#### Default Visualization (One-Output Stacked Histogram)

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
auto_vis    <- simdec_visualization(output, inputs, SI)
print(auto_vis$simdec_plot)
#auto_vis$legend_table                                 # un-comment and run
```

</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="man/figures/auto_vis_legend_table.png" width="600" />
</p>

That's it, your 'SimDec' analysis is completed!

But you can customize it further.

And feel free to go an extra step in your reporting, - name the states (i.e., low, medium, high) and merge the cells of the legend with the same state. The help to make those automatic in would be greatly appreciated!

#### Custom Visualization (One-Output Stacked Histogram)

The 'simdec_visualization' function has numerous optional arguments that can be used to polish the outlook of the results, tune and play with the decomposition set-up.

Here is how you can create a custom decomposition

```{r, warning = FALSE}
order_of_variables_m   <- c(0, 2, 1, 0)                                                   # Specifying the order of variables for decomposition,
                                                                                          # use 0 to exclude. In this example, we set that the
                                                                                          # third input variable to be used first, and then
                                                                                          # the second variable.

number_of_states_m     <- c(0, 3, 2, 0)                                                   # Specifying the number of states for each variable. The
                                                                                          # position corresponds to the original order of inputs.

state_boundaries_m     <- matrix(c(NA, min(inputs[,2]), min(inputs[,3]),                  # Specifying numeric thresholds for every state
                                   NA, NA, 100, 657.5, NA,  
                                   NA, 650, max(inputs[,3]),
                                   NA, NA, max(inputs[,2]), NA, NA),
                                 nrow = max(number_of_states_m)+1,
                                 ncol = length(order_of_variables_m),
                                 byrow = TRUE)  

main_colors_m          <- c('#8c5eff', '#ffe252', '#0dd189')                              # Specifying the main colors to be used

custom_vis             <- simdec_visualization(output, inputs, SI,                        # Storing the results in an object called "custom_vis"
                                               order_of_variables = order_of_variables_m,
                                               number_of_states   = number_of_states_m,
                                               state_boundaries   = state_boundaries_m,
                                               main_colors        = main_colors_m)
print(custom_vis$simdec_plot)                                                             # Viewing the plot
#custom_vis$legend_table                                                                  # un-comment and run
```

#### Boxplot

Adding option plot_type = "Boxplot" in the 'simdec_visualization' function  displays the results in the form of boxplot instead of stacked histogram.

```{r}
vis_boxplot <- simdec_visualization(output, inputs, SI, plot_type = "Boxplot")
print(vis_boxplot$box_plot)
# vis_boxplot$legend_table                           # un-comment and run
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="man/figures/boxplot.png" />
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="man/figures/boxplot_legend.png" width="600" />
</p>

The boxplot visualization presents exactly the same decomposition and contains the same scenarios, color-coded in the same way as in the stacked histogram.

A boxplot is handy when some scenarios have little data and are poorly visible on the histogram.

#### Two-Output Scatterhist

If relationship between two output variables is in question, the 'simdec_visualization' function can build a scatter plot with two corresponding histograms on the top and right side, all decomposed and colored by the logic created for the main output variable.

To create the scatterhist one needs to specify the second output variable for the argument 'otput_2', additional optional arguments include 'Scatter_Fraction', which defines how many dots are shown on the scatter plot (1 - all, 0.5 - every second). For other optional arguments run '?simdec_visualization'.

```{r}
data("example_data_2")
output_1        <- example_data_2[, 1]
output_2        <- example_data_2[, 2]
inputs          <- example_data_2[, 3:10]
sen    <- sensitivity_indices(output, inputs)     
SI     <- sen$SI

# un-comment and run 

# vis_scatterhist <- simdec_visualization(output_1, inputs, SI, output_2, Scatter_Fraction = 0.005)
# vis_scatterhist$scatter_hist
# vis_scatterhist$legend_table
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="man/figures/scatterhist.png" width="1000" />
</p>


<p align="center">
  <img src="man/figures/scatterhist_legend.png" width="600" />
</p>

We can change x- and y-axes limits for both histograms, the scatter plot scales accordingly. 

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# custom_scatterhist <- simdec_visualization(output   = output_1,
#                                            inputs   = inputs,
#                                            SI       = SI,
#                                            output_2 = output_2,
#                                            XLim     = c(1000, 3000),
#                                            YLim     = c(0, 4), 
#                                            Scatter_Fraction = 0.005)
# custom_scatterhist$scatter_hist            # un-comment and run 
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="man/figures/custom_scatterhist.png" />
</p>


(The graph demonstrates that not only Output1 axis has been changed as specified in the code above (scatter plot x-axis), but the second histogram has been automatically truncated as well (x-axis of the rotated right histogram and the corresponding y-axis of the scatter plot) to avoid empty space in the scatter plot.)

If the full control over the both axes of the scatterplot is needed, both 'XLim' and 'XLim2' should be specified.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# un-comment and run

# custom_scatterhist_2 <- simdec_visualization(output   = output_1,
#                                              inputs   = inputs,
#                                              SI       = SI,
#                                              output_2 = output_2,
#                                              XLim     = c(1000, 3000),
#                                              XLim2     = c(0, 1000),
#                                              Scatter_Fraction = 0.005)
# custom_scatterhist_2$scatter_hist
```
